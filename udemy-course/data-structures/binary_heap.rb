# Another category of trees
# Lots of types of heaps
# Focus on min and max heaps

# MaxBinaryHeap
# Parent node value is always larger than child nodes
# No guarantees between sibling nodes, unlike binary search tree
# Binary heap is as compact as possible, all children of each node are as full as they can be
# MinBinaryHeap - child nodes are always larger than their parent node
